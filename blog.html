<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>Welcome to the official Atomic Mills website! Glad you found us.</p>

<p>We made some waves decades ago with Flappy Flakes, Nukey Nectar, and Honey Thunder Cola, maybe you have heard of them (or maybe your grandparents have!).</p>

<p>For a long time, people said Atomic Mills was too experimental, too radioactive, too far ahead of its time.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to the Internet, we finally have a chance to bring our story, and hopefully some new products, back to life.</p>

<p>This is our first official Atomic Mills website. It is still under construction (kind of like the parking lot at the old plant), but stick around. We will be posting more about our history, our products, and maybe even a few new experiments for the 21st century.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>- J</p>
