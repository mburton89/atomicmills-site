  <h1>About Atomic Mills</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><b>Founded in 1939</b>, Atomic Mills was born at the intersection of post-war optimism and experimental breakfast science.</p>

    <p>Led by visionary Dean Lockhart, we pioneered nuclear-powered food such as <i>Flappy Flakes™</i> breakfast cereal and <i>Nukey Nectar™</i>—the world’s first honey made from radioactive bees. By harnessing the raw power of nuclear energy, Nukey Nectar™ provides unmatched speed and strength to those bold enough to spread it on their toast.</p>

    <p>Our mission? To energize the morning with science, sunshine, and a wholesome blast of innovation.</p>
