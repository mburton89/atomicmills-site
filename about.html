  <h1>About Atomic Mills</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><b>Founded in 1939</b>, Atomic Mills was born at the intersection of post-war optimism and experimental breakfast science.</p>
    <p>Led by visionary Dean Lockhart, we pioneered nuclear-powered cereals such as <i>Flappy Flakes™</i> and <i>Nukey Nectar™</i>, giving generations of citizens the radiant start to their day they didn’t know they needed.</p>
    <p>Our mission? To energize the morning with science, sunshine, and a dash of mild paranoia.</p>
